### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer currently looking for a new opportunities. Former employers can be found on my Linked In.

I've coded in React, Next, Angular, ExtJs, Vue, vanilla, jquery and done some basic local site building from raw HTML/CSS. I've worked with Spring Boot, Quarkus and visited the ancient ones (STRUTS). I've written a few bash scripts as well as a few command and python scripts. I used to run with the C++ crowd, but haven't had to run a make file in quite some time.

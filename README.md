### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer currently looking for a new opportunities. Former employers can be found on my Linked In. I enjoy building applications that people want to use.

I've coded in React, Next, Angular, ExtJs, Vue, vanilla, jquery and done some basic local site building from raw HTML/CSS. I've worked with Spring Boot, Quarkus and visited the ancient ones (STRUTS). I've written a few bash scripts as well as a few command and python scripts. I used to run with the C++ crowd, but haven't had to run a make file in quite some time. I've worked with LabVIEW when mentoring for FIRST robotics as well as a in college.

I have a passion for modding/hacking devices and re-using old technology to give it new life.
